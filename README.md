# Assignment2
Networking and Distributed Systems Diagnostics Tools

## Assignment Documentation:
Group Project, Assignment 2

Create an application that queries the operating system and runs several diagnostic tools on the network.
Work with the students assigned to your project team to design and develop the solution in any language. 

	Your program should first determine the host machine's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and subnet information.

	It should next prompt the user for an IP address or a FQDN for a machine to test and accept IPv4 or IPv6.

	The application should first query DNS to determine the IP address for the FQDN, or the FQDN for the IP.

	The application will use ICMPv4 or ICMPv6 (depending on the input) to ping and trace route to that target. 

	It should provide results in a user friendly format on the screen, and prompt to send the results to a printer. 

Provide a detailed solution to the exercise documenting your work and including clearly written comments.
Submit the solution with a readme.txt explanation in a .zip file. Be prepared to explain your solution in class.
